I successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for the hospitality domain using data from five CSV files: dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings.

The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, DSRN, DURN, DBRN, Realisation, Cancellation %, and Average Ratings. To achieve this, I performed data transformation using Power Query and calculated additional columns and measures using DAX.

The dashboard offers valuable insights and visualizations, including comparisons of KPIs between weekdays and weekends, Realisation % and ADR with booking platforms, revenue share with hotel categories, KPI trends over weeks, and KPI performance across different properties.

This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and DAX calculations for the hospitality industry, and I'm proud to present it in my portfolio and resume as a testament to my data-driven decision-making skills.
